# HarborGrill – Vercel Deployable Example (Next.js 14 + Tailwind)

This repo contains the Harbor Grill example page and minimal UI components.  
Push to GitHub and import into Vercel for instant deploy.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies with the lockfile to mirror Vercel’s build step, then launch the local dev server:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Verification

Lint and type-check the project and produce a production build before pushing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm start
```
